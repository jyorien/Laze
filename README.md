# Laze
A fusion between TikTok and Carousell but for errands. For lazy people, from a lazy person. (Also an experiment with Jetpack Compose!)

## Features
### Jetpack Compose
- This project was for me to try out Jetpack Compose, which is Android's new declarative UI kit written in Kotlin
- Compared to the traditional XML layouts, Jetpack Compose makes it much easier to create beautiful UI with less code

### Swipe to scroll
- In TikTok, you scroll for entertaining short clips. In Laze, you scroll to find errands to complete for a few extra bucks!
- Swipe was implemented with ViewPager2

### Chat with the person giving errands
- Since the app's goal is to connect people, chat is an essential feature!
- Chats are stored in Firestore

### CameraX used for camera function
- CameraX, Android's new Camera API in Jetpack, was used with Jetpack Compose.
